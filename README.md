# Internet-Censorship-A-Data-Driven-Investigation

## **Overview**

Internet censorship restricts access to information and suppresses freedom of expression through methods like DNS blocking, TCP/IP filtering, and HTTP throttling. Analyzing censored network data over time can uncover targeted content types, censorship frequencies, and evolving practices. This project examines a dataset from Russia (October 2022) to identify patterns, enforcement techniques, and changes in censorship dynamics, aiding efforts to promote digital freedom and develop anti-censorship tools.

## **Data**

OONI is an open-source initiative that detects and documents internet censorship, traffic manipulation, and network performance issues globally, using a dataset from October 2022 of Russia with over 1,000,000 measurements.
